Introduction:-
Every year around 17 million people die due to Cardiovascular diseases. This mainly consists of heart failures. There are various laboratory tests available 
through which a person can obtain some useful results. For example, Creatinine phosphokinase responsible in regeneration of ATP, when in excess can lead to 
numerous heart related diseases. In the same way there are other components present in the body which can guide us to keep a check on the progression of 
heart the failure. Results of these different tests and some daily habits and some other features can be used in Machine Learning to predict the survival 
rate of a person from Cardiovascular disease which can be unseen by a doctor.
